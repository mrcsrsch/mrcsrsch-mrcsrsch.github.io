I hold a PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a specialisation in international economics, econometrics, and labor economics. Since 2019, I have been affiliated with Statistics Netherlands. In my work, I apply methods from causal inference and machine learning to large-scale economic datasets. Additionally, I am fascinated by prediction and dimension reduction techniques from supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as the integration of machine learning methods in causal analysis.

I am an advocate for open science and replication. This website showcases my current and past projects, and it serves as a repository for the corresponding replication packages.

Check [*this replication package*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/research/2_2023_careers/) for an example of one of my projects in R.

[*Here*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/portfolio/1_2024_ML_R/) I've implemented various algorithms from machine Learning and artificial intelligence in R.
