I am graduating with a PhD in Economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam in October 2024, with a specialization in international economics, econometrics, and labor economics. Since 2019, I have also been affiliated with Statistics Netherlands. My research primarily applies causal inference methods to large-scale economic datasets. Additionally, I am fascinated by prediction and dimension reduction techniques from supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as the integration of machine learning methods in causal analysis.

I am an advocate for open science and replication. This website showcases my current and past projects, and it serves as a repository for the corresponding replication packages.
