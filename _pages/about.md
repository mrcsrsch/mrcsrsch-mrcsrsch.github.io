I hold a PhD in Economics with a specialization in Applied Econometrics, International Trade and Labor Economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam. Since 2019, I've been affiliated with Statistics Netherlands and recently served as a Data Scientist for the management team at Erasmus School of Economics. My work focuses on applying causal inference and machine learning techniques to large-scale datasets.

Check [*this replication package*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/research/2_2023_careers/) for an example of one of my larger research projects in Economics ("Careers in Multinational Enterprises").

[*Here*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/portfolio/1_2024_ML_R/), I've implemented some algorithms from machine learning and artificial intelligence in R.

As an advocate for open science and replication, I ensure that my work is accessible and reproducible. Replication packages for individual projects can be found under the [*Portfolio*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/portfolio/) section.
