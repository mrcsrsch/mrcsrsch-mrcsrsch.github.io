I hold a PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a specialisation in international economics, labor economics, and econometrics. Since 2019, I have been affiliated with Statistics Netherlands and currently work as a post-doctoral researcher for the management team of Erasmus School of Economics. My work primarily involves applying methods from causal inference and machine learning to large-scale economic datasets. I also have a strong interest in prediction and dimension reduction techniques from supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and I explore how these methods can complement causal analysis. My research focuses on how changes in firms, markets, and policies impact local labor markets.

I am an advocate for open science and replication. This website showcases my current and past projects, and it serves as a repository for the corresponding replication packages.

Check [*this replication package*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/research/2_2023_careers/) for an example of one of my larger research projects ("Careers in Multinational Enterprises").

[*Here*](https://mrcsrsch.github.io/portfolio/1_2024_ML_R/), I've implemented some algorithms from machine learning and artificial intelligence in R.
