I implement some common machine learning algorithms from scratch in R. While I hope that the implementations are helpful to other, they are largely exercises to enhance my own understanding of what happens under the "hood" in more efficient, packaged solutions. The algorithms are taken from academic papers and the book: Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2017).
