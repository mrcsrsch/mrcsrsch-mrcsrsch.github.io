title: "Machine Learning Algorithms in R"

I implement some common machine learning algorithms from scratch in R. The implementations are to develop my own understanding of what happens under the "hood" in more efficient, packaged solutions. The algorithms are mostly taken from academic paers and Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2017). [*The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference, and prediction.*](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/NoHesitations/BookAdvanced.pdf)
